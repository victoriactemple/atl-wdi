//  Also add a method to catch an error if something goes wrong

Figuring out how to add condiments is completely up to you. Itâ€™s served in a big bowl of french fries and tater tots covered, in lots of our Cheesy-Cheese Goo. Enjoy!`

// 5. Validate that the new item has been added to the menu by calling `readMenu` again.

// Loop through each customer and use the `.order` function on each object within the array.
